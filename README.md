A curated collection of high-quality resources, papers, and tools dedicated to Automotive Radar SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and odometry. This repository is designed to assist researchers and engineers in discovering leading materials for radar-based localization, mapping, and sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles. While many SLAM methods exist for Navtech radar, this list specifically highlights on-chip automotive radar SLAM and odometryâ€”a fast-growing area with significant recent advancements.

## Overview

Automotive radar is robust to adverse weather and lighting, making it a key sensor for autonomous vehicles. Radar SLAM and odometry enable accurate localization and mapping using radar data, often in combination with other sensors. This list covers:

- Pure radar-based SLAM and odometry
- Radar-inertial fusion
- Multi-sensor fusion (radar, lidar, camera, GNSS, etc.)
- Radar data representations and learning (tensors, deep learning)
